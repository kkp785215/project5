        <span>Sarkari Result 2021 : SarkariResult.Com</span>
        <p> India has witnessed a high demand for Government jobs for many decades. People prefer Government jobs as
            their career option considering the wide variety of benefits that are associated with these. ‘Sarkari
            Naukri’ is a dream for millions of people across the nation, and only a few are lucky to land up with such
            jobs. People tend to take pride in having a Sarkari or Government job.</p>
        <p>Government jobs hold the kind of authority not found in private jobs. These also offer job security for a
            lifetime, and hence a lot of youth prefer them. Getting into a Government job requires a person to go
            through multiple levels of tests. These include a written examination, interview and sometimes even physical
            examination. These are competitive exams, and millions of people appear for these exams to get into a
            coveted Government job.</p>

        <span>How Competitive Is the Government Job Market?</span>
        <p> There is no doubt that finding an Indian government job is highly competitive. The Times of India said it
            best when they said that the numbers are staggering:</p>
        <li>2.3 million applications for 368 peon positions in Uttar Pradesh.</li>
        <li>2.5 million applications for 6,000 positions in Bengal </li>
        <li>200,000 applications for 1,137 positions as police constables in Maharashtra. </li>
        <p> When the Ministry of Railways started recruiting for around 63,000 positions, they received more than 19
            million (1.9 crores) job applications.</p>
        <p> With COVID-19, the competition has only increased because of the drop in the number of people hired by the
            government. The central government hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a reduction in almost 32,000 jobs.
            There was a similar drop in 2021 of almost 107,000 people hired by the state government. This creates an
            extremely competitive environment. Getting up-to-date information on the latest jobs on Sarkari Result and
            understanding eligibility requirements can help you stand out from the crowd. These are of course some of
            the most coveted roles in India and are extremely competitive.</p>
